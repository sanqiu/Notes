====== Cgroup ======
Created Wednesday 07 January 2015

The control groups, abbreviated as cgroups in this guide, are a Linux kernel feature that allows you to allocate resources — such as CPU time, system memory, network bandwidth, or combinations of these resources — among hierarchically ordered groups of processes running on a system.
将cpu，内存，带宽，或者这几种资源的混合**定量分配**给已经过等级划分的进程（组）用户（组）使用。
