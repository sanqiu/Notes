A few "magical" PHP constants
Name							Description
__LINE__						The current line number of the file.
__FILE__							The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned.
__DIR__							The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.

__FUNCTION__					The function name.
__CLASS__						The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar). Note that as of PHP 5.4 __CLASS__ works also in traits. When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.

__TRAIT__						The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar).
__METHOD__						The class method name.
__NAMESPACE__					The name of the current namespace.
